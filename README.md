COLUMNS:				
	* **type**	equipment/sensor/monitor		
	* **name**			
	* **url**	This is for monitor only

So they are three types devices, E/S/M, M doesn't not need API. and E/S will generate different APIs.				
E: LED, light, etc. They only have two status, active/inactive. We use a checkbox to control it.				
S: We didn't control it. they send real time data to the server, and the server will generate a report. User can can see the report in mobile phone				
M: They are cameras, for now we only support one camera.
